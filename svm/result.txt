The result is a classification report that provides an evaluation of the SVM model's performance on the test set. In the report, the model's predictions are compared to the true labels. The report presents several important metrics for binary classification, including precision, recall, f1-score, and accuracy. In this case, class "0.0" represents one class (e.g., no liver recurrence) and class "1.0" represents the other class (e.g., liver recurrence). Let's explain each metric:

Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model (i.e., true positives / (true positives + false positives)). Precision measures how accurate the model's positive predictions are.

Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances (i.e., true positives / (true positives + false negatives)). Recall measures the model's ability to correctly identify all positive instances.

F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall. The F1-score is a single metric that balances both precision and recall. It is especially useful when the class distribution is imbalanced.

Support: The number of instances in each class in the test set.

Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions out of all predictions made by the model (i.e., (true positives + true negatives) / total instances). Accuracy measures the overall performance of the model.

Macro Avg: The average of the metrics for each class, without considering the class distribution. Macro average treats all classes as equally important.

Weighted Avg: The average of the metrics for each class, weighted by the number of instances in each class (i.e., support). Weighted average considers the class distribution and gives more importance to larger classes.

Based on the report, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.97 on the test set, indicating that it correctly predicted 97% of the instances. The precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes are also high, suggesting that the model performed well in identifying both classes.






The "age" feature is a continuous numeric variable, not a binary variable, so it doesn't need to be included in the binary_columns list. The binary_columns list is only used to convert binary categorical columns to numeric format (0 or 1).

The "age" feature is already a numeric variable, so it doesn't require the same type of encoding as binary categorical variables. It will be automatically included in the X DataFrame when selecting features, and it will be considered by the SelectKBest method when performing feature selection.

In summary, you don't need to make any additional changes to the code to consider the "age" feature. It is already included as part of the X DataFrame, and it will be considered along with other features for selection and modeling.










The differences in the selected features between the code with scikit-learn and the code without scikit-learn can be attributed to several factors:

Different feature selection methods: In the scikit-learn code, the feature selection method used is SelectKBest with mutual_info_classif as the scoring function. This method selects the top k features based on mutual information with the target variable. In the code without scikit-learn, the feature selection method is based on feature variances, which selects the top k features with the highest variances. Mutual information and variance are different measures, and they capture different aspects of the features' relationships with the target variable.

Different handling of missing values: In the scikit-learn code, missing values are imputed using the median of each column with the SimpleImputer class. In the code without scikit-learn, missing values are handled using the simple_imputer function, which performs similar imputation. However, any differences in how missing values are handled can affect the results of feature selection.

Different standardization/scaling methods: Feature scaling can affect the results of feature selection methods. Any differences in scaling methods between the two implementations can lead to different feature selection outcomes.

Randomness: Some feature selection methods or model training processes may involve randomness. For example, mutual information can be estimated with some degree of randomness. Different random seeds or random states can result in slightly different feature rankings.

These factors, combined with the inherent differences between the two implementations, can lead to different sets of selected features. Note that feature selection is an exploratory process, and there is no guarantee that two different methods will produce the same results. It is common to try different feature selection methods and evaluate the model's performance to identify the best set of features for the specific problem.
